Awesome—let’s bake a **Vulnerability Watch** feature into Sara Hub that’s fast, reliable, and prioritized for Microsoft + zero-days.

# What to poll (and why)

## 1) Microsoft-first sources (earliest & authoritative)

* **MSRC Security Update Guide RSS** – quickest heads-up from Microsoft when something new/updated lands. Use this for lightweight, frequent polling. ([Microsoft Security Response Center][1])
  `https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/rss/` (MSRC blog RSS; includes “Security Update Guide” category posts)
* **MSRC CVRF API v3.0** – canonical, structured details (CVEs, affected products, KBs, mitigations). Pull by month (Patch Tuesday + OOB). No API key. ([Microsoft Security Response Center][2], [api.msrc.microsoft.com][3])
  Example: `https://api.msrc.microsoft.com/cvrf/v3.0/cvrf/2024-Jan` (XML). ([api.msrc.microsoft.com][3])

**Why both?** RSS gives you the **earliest signal**, the CVRF API gives you the **full, queryable payload** to build reports. Microsoft confirmed v3.0 rollout without breaking invocation. ([Microsoft Security Response Center][2])

## 2) “Exploited in the wild” signal (prioritize!)

* **CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog** – the authoritative “this is being used by attackers” list. Use it to flag/boost urgency in your report. ([CISA][4])

## 3) Enrichment & cross-vendor context

* **NVD API** – CVSS scoring, CWE, references; sometimes lags MITRE/vendors by hours, but best for normalized scoring. ([NVD][5])
  (If you prefer bulk sync, NVD JSON feeds + “modified” feed keep you current.) ([NVD][6])
* **MITRE CVE site / services** – CVE existence/metadata straight from the program (some endpoints require creds; still useful as a truth source for IDs). ([CVE][7], [CVE Awg][8])

## 4) Zero-day chatter / PoCs (earliest exploit hints)

* **Google Project Zero blog** (and RSS) – high-signal zero-day writeups across vendors, including Microsoft. ([Project Zero][9], [Feeder][10])
* **Exploit-DB** – PoCs often show up here; useful to flag “exploit available.” (Poll recent entries via site/RSS scraping if needed.) ([Exploit Database][11])
* (Optional) **Vendor PSIRTs** you care about (e.g., Cisco advisories RSS) for your environment. ([Cisco][12])

---

# Polling cadence (practical)

* **MSRC RSS**: every **15–30 min** during business hours; hourly otherwise. (Tiny payload, fast.) ([Microsoft Security Response Center][1])
* **MSRC CVRF API**:

  * **Patch Tuesday** (2nd Tue monthly): poll **hourly** for that month’s doc for the first 24–48h.
  * Otherwise: poll **daily** for the current month (and previous month for stragglers). ([Microsoft Security Response Center][2])
* **CISA KEV**: check **daily** (or twice daily if you want faster exploited flags). ([CISA][4])
* **NVD API / Feeds**: **daily** sync; use the **modified** feed for deltas. ([NVD][6])
* **Project Zero / Exploit-DB**: **daily** (or 2–3x/day if you want early PoC alerts). ([Project Zero][9], [Exploit Database][11])

# Normalization pipeline (so your report is clean)

1. **Ingest events**

   * Trigger: New MSRC RSS item → derive the month → fetch **MSRC CVRF** XML. ([Microsoft Security Response Center][1], [api.msrc.microsoft.com][3])
   * Also run scheduled fetches for **KEV** and **NVD**.
2. **Parse & model**

   * Key: `cve_id` (primary key).
   * Fields: `title`, `msrc_severity`, `cvss_base` (from NVD), `affected_products` (from MSRC), `kb_articles`, `release_date`, `last_modified`, `exploit_available` (Exploit-DB heuristic), `known_exploited` (KEV boolean), `references`. ([api.msrc.microsoft.com][3], [NVD][5], [CISA][4])
3. **De-dupe & upsert**

   * Upsert by `cve_id`. Keep `source_timestamps` so your daily report can show “new today” vs “updated today”.
4. **Prioritize**

   * `priority = max(msrc_severity_weight, nvd_cvss_weight) + KEV_bonus + exploit_poc_bonus`. KEV and PoC should bump to the top. ([CISA][4], [NVD][5])
5. **Report & alerts**

   * Generate a **daily digest** (Markdown/HTML) grouped by **New**, **Updated**, **Known Exploited**, **PoC Available**.
   * Fire alerts to Slack/Email for KEV-listed or Criticals.

# Concrete endpoints (drop-in)

* **MSRC CVRF (monthly)**:
  `https://api.msrc.microsoft.com/cvrf/v3.0/cvrf/<YYYY-Mmm>` → XML (e.g., `2024-Jan`). ([api.msrc.microsoft.com][3])
* **MSRC blog RSS** (Security Update items show here):
  `https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/rss/` ([Microsoft Security Response Center][1])
* **CISA KEV Catalog** (CSV/JSON linked on page; scrape or fetch published data formats):
  Catalog page: [https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) ([CISA][4])
* **NVD CVE API v2** (example – query recent modifications):
  Docs: [https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities) ([NVD][5])
* **NVD JSON Feeds** (bulk + “modified”):
  [https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds) ([NVD][6])
* **Project Zero** blog: [https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/) (RSS available via standard blogspot feed). ([Project Zero][9])
* **Exploit-DB** recent exploits: [https://www.exploit-db.com/](https://www.exploit-db.com/) (no official API; scrape RSS-like pages or diff recent listing). ([Exploit Database][11])

# Sara Hub integration plan

**Backend (FastAPI)**

* **/ingest/msrc\_rss** – fetch & diff feed GUIDs → enqueue month keys.
* **/ingest/msrc\_cvrf?month=YYYY-Mmm** – fetch+parse XML → upsert CVEs/products/KBs.
* **/ingest/cisa\_kev** – pull KEV → set `known_exploited=true` on matches.
* **/ingest/nvd\_modified** – pull modified since last run → update CVSS/CWE.
* **/ingest/poc\_watch** – check Exploit-DB recent; set `exploit_available=true` when titles reference a CVE.

**Storage**

* Postgres tables: `cves`, `products`, `references`, `vendors`, `source_events`.
* Indices on `cve_id`, `(known_exploited, cvss_base DESC)`, `last_modified`.

**Scheduler**

* Celery/Temporal/NATS worker cadence per “Polling cadence” above. (You already use Temporal—perfect for retries + observability.)

**UI**

* **Dashboard cards**:

  * “New Today” (count)
  * “KEV (Actively Exploited)” (count)
  * “Critical/High (MSRC or CVSS≥8.0)”
* **Filters**: Product (Windows, Office, Exchange, Azure), Severity, KEV, PoC.
* **Detail drawer**: CVE summary, affected products, KBs, MSRC/NVD links, KEV status, PoC link.

**Daily report**

* Generate Markdown/HTML and store; show an in-app “Reports” list (downloadable).
* Email/Slack push when: new KEV, new Critical, or PoC appears for Microsoft CVE.

# Sample flow (pseudo):

1. **RSS tick** → “new SUG post” → derive month “2025-Aug”. ([Microsoft Security Response Center][1])
2. GET **CVRF 2025-Aug** → parse `Vulnerability` nodes → upsert CVEs & products. ([Microsoft Security Response Center][2])
3. Join with **NVD** to pull CVSS/CWE; join with **KEV** to mark exploited; check **Exploit-DB** for PoC. ([NVD][5], [CISA][4], [Exploit Database][11])
4. Compute priority; emit alerts + render report.
