## Integration Points with Existing Sara Features

### Synergies
- **Memory System**: Habits create episodic memories for coaching
- **Notes**: Link habits to related notes for context
- **Documents**: Connect habits to research/guides
- **Timers**: Seamless integration for time-bound habits
- **Analytics**: Habit data enhances dashboard insights
- **Chat**: AI coaching based on habit patterns

### Minimal Conflicts
- **Navigation**: Add "Habits" to existing sidebar
- **Database**: New tables won't impact existing features
- **Worker Processes**: Isolated background jobs

## Questions for Clarification

1. **Priority Level**: Is this urgent for production or can we implement methodically?

2. **Migration Strategy**: Should we implement all habit types at once or start with binary habits?

3. **Neo4j Schema**: Do you want habits to connect to existing vulnerability reports and calendar events?

4. **AI Integration**: Should Sara proactively suggest habits based on notes/conversations?

5. **Mobile Experience**: Any specific mobile optimizations needed beyond responsive design?

6. **Health Integrations**: Priority level for step/sleep/water bridges mentioned in spec?

## Estimated Timeline

**Total Implementation**: 10-14 working days

- **Backend Core**: 4-5 days
- **Frontend UI**: 3-4 days  
- **Workers & Integration**: 2-3 days
- **Testing & Polish**: 1-2 days

**Parallel Development**: Backend and Frontend can be developed simultaneously after Phase 1 is complete.

Would you like me to start with the **database migrations and core models**, or would you prefer to adjust any of these tasks/priorities first?
